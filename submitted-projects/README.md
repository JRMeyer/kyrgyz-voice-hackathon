## Ottuu Tulku: An Augmented Reality Mobile App for Kyrgyz Language Education

Ottuu Tulku (Firefox) is a Mozilla Common Voice hackathon project for children education in Kyrgyz language It is an AR mobile app developed on Unity. We combined education and entertainment to involve children in the process of learning. First option of Ottuu Tulku is an AR fairytale with sound. We pregenerated voice for the fairytale, but the idea is to allow teachers to make small changes to the story, so you might want to use Common Voice to make it dynamic and generate voice on air. The educational part is a Kyrgyz language dictation test, the app is playing a voice recording, while student has to type it up on the screen. The Ottuu Tulku will notify him with a text message if he makes a mistake.

## Kyrgyz Sentiment Analysis

Two different sentiment analysis were implemented to determine the "mood" of a sentence: positive, negative or neutral. An input sentence is translated to english thus the model works for any language (Universal Sentiment Analysis). Tools from Stanford CoreNLP and VADER-Sentiment-Analysis repository were used. The translation was done by using translate services from Google and Yandex. Stanford CoreNLP is a deep learning model and VADER-Sentiment-Analysis is a dictionary based model. The latter splits the input sentence to tokens and applies grammatical and syntactical rules to compare it with the dictionary. The former model predominantly uses probabilistic machine learning and deep learning components and does not use any rules.
