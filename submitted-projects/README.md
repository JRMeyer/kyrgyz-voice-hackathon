## Ottuu Tulku: An Augmented Reality Mobile App for Kyrgyz Language Education

Ottuu Tulku (Firefox) is a Mozilla Common Voice hackathon project for children education in Kyrgyz language It is an AR mobile app developed on Unity. We combined education and entertainment to involve children in the process of learning. First option of Ottuu Tulku is an AR fairytale with sound. We pregenerated voice for the fairytale, but the idea is to allow teachers to make small changes to the story, so you might want to use Common Voice to make it dynamic and generate voice on air. The educational part is a Kyrgyz language dictation test, the app is playing a voice recording, while student has to type it up on the screen. The Ottuu Tulku will notify him with a text message if he makes a mistake.
